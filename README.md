# Vendor Performance Analytics

In the retail and wholesale industry, it is important to maintain effective inventory and sales management practices to optimize profit. This goal is achieved by companies through checking and ensuring they are not incurring losses due inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor dependency.
This project uses SQL, Python, PowerBI, and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze the sales, pricing, purchases, freight, and inventory information of various brands.

The goal of the analysis is to:
- identify underperforming brands that require pricing readjustment or promotions
- determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit
- analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs
- assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency
- investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors
